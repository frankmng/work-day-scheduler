## Description

The purpose of this project is to provide users with a work day scheduler that helps them add tasks to be done throughout a 9-5 work day. The tasks are saved to local storage in order to keep the task name persistent on the calendar. Each time block is colored to show whether the time block is in the past, present or future.
